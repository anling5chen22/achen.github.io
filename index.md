The average number of reviews for all neighborhoods is highest in the theater district, with 2.7 reviews per month, followed by Tribeca, Hell’s Kitchen, and East Village, respectively. From this data, we can see that the places with higher rents, such as Tribeca and East Village, also have more reviews per month on average than other neighborhoods. East Village lies about in the middle of the average number of reviews for all neighbourhoods, showing that there is a large population that are staying there for not too long, but also not too short of a time, but perhaps for a regular weeklong vacation. This is for those looking for affordable places or short stays, not living for a long time. 

_Chart 3:_

<img src="Average price compared to other neighborhoods.png" class="inline"/>

The average price per night in East Village is 5.8% less than the average price per night in Manhattan. Compared to other neighborhoods, such as West Village, Chinatown, and East Harlem, East Village ranks second in terms of average price. West Village surpasses it with $270 dollars a night, while East Village has an average price of $186. This is in line with the analysis of the desirability of East Village compared to other neighbourhoods in Manhattan. The more desirable a neighborhood, the higher price it will require per night. Still, East Village is still several points lower than the borough average, showing that it is not considered a very wealthy or desirable area where it would fetch higher prices.

_Chart 4:_

<img src="Pie graph of room type listings.png" class="inline"/>

    Listings that contain private rooms:  660
    Listings that contain entire rooms or apartments:  1170
    Listings that are shared rooms:  23

The majority of rooms types in East Village are entire rooms or apartments, but there is also about a third of airbnbs that are for private rooms. From this, we may assume that vacationers are looking for large, private apartments for families or people travelling in a group. However, there is also a prominent population of individuals travelling alone, such as for overnight stays or solo trips. This goes along with the HC2 analysis that this place is good for families and groups looking for lots of activities. A very small number of shared rooms show that this place is not the most prominent spot for those looking to meet new people or those looking for a very affordable deal. 

_Chart 5:_

<img src="Average number of reviews for all nbhds.png" class="inline"/>

The average number of reviews per month is about on par with the average number of reviews in Manhattan, showing that an average amount of people would stay in the East Village region without staying for a long time, or staying for a short stay, such as overnight or as a midway stop between travelling to another location. This is on par with the analysis in that many families would prefer to stay here.
